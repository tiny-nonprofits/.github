# Tiny Nonprofits
A GitHub org for hosting GitHub Pages sites for tiny non-profits.

GitHub Pages is a great way to host low-traffic, simple, static pages for small non-profits, but I wanted a way to keep them separate from my other projects.
If you're in a similar situation, [open an Issue](https://github.com/tiny-nonprofits/.github/issues) and we could potentially add your repo(s) here also!

# How To

1. Purchase domain name (I use [namecheap.com](https://namecheap.com) because it's inexpensive and has Basic DNS included!)
2. Configure DNS so the `@` (aka apex) hostname points to the [4x A records listed here](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site/managing-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site#configuring-an-apex-domain), and the `www` hostname is a CNAME pointing to `tiny-nonprofits.github.io`.
3. Go to the repo Settings and configure the Page.
